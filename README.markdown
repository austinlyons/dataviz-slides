# Slides for DSM Web Geeks talk
These slides accompany the data visualization talk and [Untappd beer data viz demo](https://github.com/austinlyons/beer-dataviz-code) I gave at DSM Web Geeks.

These slides are a React app! 

You can see the slide code [here](https://github.com/austinlyons/dataviz-slides/blob/master/presentation/index.js).

Also, some of the slides have dynamic functionality, like [this](https://github.com/austinlyons/dataviz-slides/blob/master/assets/redditPosts.js) and [this](https://github.com/austinlyons/dataviz-slides/blob/master/assets/interactive.js).

It's hot reloading, so you can change the code and hit save without refreshing... makes for a fun party trick.

**Run the slides locally**
* clone this repo
* npm install
* npm start
* visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
