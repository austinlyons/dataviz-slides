# Slides for DSM Web Geeks talk
These slides are a React app!

You can see the slide code [here](https://github.com/austinlyons/dataviz-slides/blob/master/presentation/index.js).

Also, some of the slides have dynamic functionality, like [this](https://github.com/austinlyons/dataviz-slides/blob/master/assets/redditPosts.js) and [this](https://github.com/austinlyons/dataviz-slides/blob/master/assets/interactive.js).

It's hot reloading, so you can change the code and hit save without refreshing... makes for a fun party trick.

Run the slides locally
* clone this repo
* npm install
* npm start
